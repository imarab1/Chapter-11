### 11.4 partition
This program has a method called partition, it accepts a list of integers as well as another integer value E. All values that are less than E are sorted so that they are before the value of E, any values that are larger than E come after. The order in which the elements are in does not matter. 

### 11.5 sortAndRemoveDuplicates
This program has a method called sortAndRemoveDuplicates. It accepts a list of integers as a parameter, and it sorts the list's values in sequential order. It also removes any duplicate values that the list may have. 

### 11.9 hasOdd
This program has a method called hasOdd. It accepts a set of integers as its parameter. We receive an output of true if the set contains atleast one odd number, we get an output of false if it does not, and if it is empty, then we get an output of false. 

### 11.16 is1to1
This program has a method called is1to1. It accepts a string map as its parameter. If two keys do not map to the same values. However, if they do map to the same value, we get an output of true. Finally, if the map is empty, it returns true. 


Comments/Concerns
All the testing has been done, I just wasn't sure how to show my testing when the list was empty because I needed it filled to run. I was getting my expected output when it was empty.
